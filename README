   
           IRCtree Version 1.7 for Eggdrop (c) 2000 by \RisK\
   
   
INTRODUCTION:
-------------
  
   What is irctree?
   An eggdrop module, written in C. If you don't know what eggdrop is,
   this is probably not whatever you're looking for! This module will
   convert the data returned from the irc command LINKS into a tree
   formatted graph based on the built-in bottree command. Just like the
   bottree is a nice way to get a feel for how the bots are linked so is
   irctree for how the irc servers are linked physically.
   
   
INSTALL:
--------
   
    NOTES: THIS version of irctree will ONLY work with version 1.8.4+ eggdrops
           
           You don't need to kill your bot be for installing,
           BUT you MUST have the source code.
           
           If you are using a static eggdrop you MUST reinstall
           the entire eggdrop. See note below!
           
           If you are installing the entire eggdrop you only need
           to finish the first step and then read the 'INSTALL'
           file included with eggdrop. You still need to load the
           module see step 5.
   
   1. Move irctree.mod/ to eggdrop1.8.x/src/mod/
   
   2. Type 'make modules' from the eggdrop source directory.
   
   4. irctree.so (the module) MUST be moved from the eggdrop source
      directory to your current eggdrop module directory.
        mv ./irctree.so <module directory>
        example mv ~/eggdrop1.8.x/irctree.so ~/eggdrop/modules/
   
   5. Now the module must be loaded. You can do this by telnet/dcc in
      the bot and typing '.loadmod irctree' or by adding 'loadmodule
      irctree' to your bot config so it gets automatically each loaded
      time the bot starts up.
   
   
DCC COMMANDS:
---------
   
   .irctree [-cdeh] [-f <remote server>]
     
       -c            Shows cached tree since .irctree command was last
                     used without the -c option, instead sending LINKS
                     command to the irc server and getting a fresh tree. 
       
       -d            Shows the server/hup description below server/hup.
       
       -e            Extracts the tree to make it more readable by
                     adding a blank line between servers.
       
       -h            Shows the ips/hosts of the hups.
       
       -f <server>   Will cause the irc server to forward the LINKS
                     command to the first server found that matches that
                     name (if any), and that server is then required to
                     answer the query.
   
   
EXAMPLES:
---------
   
   Here's how a plain irctree looks (no extra options).

   Here's a tree with (c)ached option in other words its the same tree
   as last time, but now with extra options; show (d)escription shows
   server info below each server; (e)xtract option will extract the tree
   to make it more readable (on smaller networks!).

   Here's a tree with show (h)hups option rather self explaining.

   Here's a tree where the -f option was used to (f)orward the LINKS  
   request to an other server as a result of getting an other view of  
   the irc tree.

FAQ:
----
   
   Q: I can't get the module to compile right what do I do?
  
   A: Make sure that:
     
       1. You are using eggdrop 1.8.4+ NOT older!
       2. Check your paths.
       3. That you have any idea whatsoever what you are doing!
       4. If it's something else try https://www.eggheads.org/
       5. Check doc/COMPILE-GUIDE for common compiling problems.
       6. Whatever you do just DO NOT email me!
   
   
   Q: I always get something like 'irctree: Error loading module:
      ld.so.1: ~/eggdrop/eggdrop: fatal: ~/eggdrop/modules/irctree.so:
      open failed: No such file or directory' when trying to use 
      '.loadmod irctree' command or after I added 'loadmodule irctree'
      line to my bot config, what did I forgot?
   
   A: Make sure that:
       1. If you have a static compiled eggdrop you must reinstall
          the entire eggdrop. See > INSTALL > NOTES
       2. You have moved the irctree.so from the eggdrop source dir
          to you eggdrop module dir!
       3. Be sure that it's the same path as defined in your config
          (set mod-path "modules/" etc.)
       3. How the hell did you get so far. You managed to unstuff
          and compile the module but you can't move it to the right
          directory?
   
   
   Q: Why didn't you make a eggdrop 1.3.x version of the module?
   
   A: I did, but not this version my first version of this module works
      only for eggdrop 1.3.x. I say if your satisfied using a 1.3.x
      you can do with a little older version of irctree, eh?
      Hey do yourself a favor and update your eggdrop since your
      already halfway there! 
   
   
   Q: But why doesn't it work with 1.5.x eggdrops?
   
      1.5.x is a development version (odd numbered minor versions) of
      cause if doesn't change the fact that this module it's should, but
      I have been getting mail saying other, but I dont give a flying
      shit, you shouldn't be using this unless your a developer or you
      know what you are doing and if so were you would have no probs
      getting this simple code to compile and work.
   
   Q: Can I use irctree to see spilts?
   
   A: No, not directly. You can use the irctree with -c and without -c
      options (if there were a cached tree in the memory) to compare and 
      see how the spilt look likes, but it really doesn't tell you what
      is spilted. (yet)
   
   Q: I noticed that you don't need ANY flags to use the irctree command
      so long as you have a partyline access! Any way to change this?
   
   A: I haven't added any support for flags in the module it self cause
      I haven't found it necessary, but there is one way to fix this.
      If you add below the 'loadmodule irctree' line:
        unbind dcc - irctree *dcc:irctree
        bind dcc <flags> irctree *dcc:irctree
      I will add is option in the next version, but for now you will
      have to do it the hard way.
   
   
KNOWN BUGS:
-----------
   
   Then using show hups options on IRCnet you may see something like
   3ffe:2900:e002:0:250:b7ff:fe14:6155 or 0:0:0:0:0:ffff:216.225.7.165
   instead of a IP or hostname. This is not a bug in the module and
   will be fixed.. someday.
